# Appendix C – Sample Modernization Profile Template

## Planning Summary

*	Of all the systems you have considered modernizing, why does modernizing this system provide the highest value?
*	Please describe the goals of the modernization effort, including plans to utilize or deploy existing cloud services, shared services, or Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), as applicable.
*	Please provide a short narrative description of the implications of maintaining the status-quo, including potential impact on the mission, personnel, and business processes of the system and on the agency. 
*	What is the schedule for the modernization? Please include intermediate milestones when new services become available, or older components are retired.
*	What risks have been identified, including cost, schedule, scope, data complexity, software development, and project management risks, as well as a risk mitigation strategy?

## Operational Risks

*	What are the estimated post-modernization operations and maintenance costs for the first year of operations?
*	Please provide anticipated cost savings and impact on the agency, mission, and personnel that the collective efforts to modernize will have.
*	What are the projected yearly and total modernization costs? Please describe the methodology used to calculate estimated costs, such as cost benefit analysis.
*	What are the costs associated with early contract termination in the event that the system is replaced or retired?
*	If the modernized system presents new user interfaces or business processes to its existing user base, what retraining costs will be incurred?
*	What types of data does this system store or process, beyond that identified in the HVA list?
*	What is the aggregate size of data stored in the existing system? What growth is expected?
*	What are the data retention requirements for data stored on the system being modernized?
*	Is a data migration plan in place?
*	What other systems will be affected by the modernization of this system? To what degree will the other systems be affected (e.g. upstream or downstream systems that will require replacement or modernization to support the modernization of this system)?
*	Which other mission-critical systems can be more easily modernized following the modernization of this system?
*	Will this modernization operate in a supported Cloud environment? If so, which environment?
*	Will this modernization split out functionality consistent with a service-oriented enterprise architecture?
*	If new services are split out, what other systems are candidates to share those services?

## Modernization Impact

*	What other systems can be retired as a result of this effort?
*	What opportunities have been identified that will create strategic technological changes to the agency at large through reuse or re-application of techniques derived from modernization?
*	What opportunities to re-engineer underlying business processes, including streamlining or consolidating complex, duplicative, or fragmented processes, have been identified?
*	When you replace this system, what other upgrades (possibly non-mission critical) become feasible, or are simplified?
*	How will Human Centered Design techniques be employed to ensure that the modernized system is more usable than its predecessor?
*	What goals have been set for improving the usability of the systems?

## Execution Ability

*	What alternatives for system modernization have been explored?
*	How does this modernization fit into the agency’s Enterprise Roadmap?
*	Will this modernization adopt lean/agile system development techniques?
*	Who are the expert staff involved in the project (names and areas of expertise)?
*	How many agency technologists will be required for this work?
*	How many agency technologists are or will be available for this work?
*	How many other staff members need to be hired or otherwise obtained?
