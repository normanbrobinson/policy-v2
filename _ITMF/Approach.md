## Approach for Information Technology Modernization

The President’s FY 2017 Budget<sup>[2](#myfootnote2)</sup> identified retiring or upgrading legacy IT systems as a key component to improving the cybersecurity and efficiency of the Federal Government.  The President’s Budget proposed increased resources for identifying and securing high-value information assets, and also proposes the creation of an IT Modernization Fund (ITMF) as a resource to retire, replace, and modernize the Federal Government’s highest-risk IT legacy systems.  

In order to improve the cybersecurity and efficiency of Federal IT systems, agencies must ensure priority planning for the modernization of high-risk IT systems and develop an updated Enterprise Roadmap, with a focus on modernization of the agency’s IT portfolio<sup>[3](#myfootnote3)</sup> .   In accordance with OMB’s authority to ensure effective information resource management<sup>[4](#myfootnote4)</sup>  and with the strategic goals described in agencies’ Enterprise Roadmaps, this guidance will require the development of targeted modernization plans for specific high-risk, high-priority systems, as further discussed below.

Moving the Federal Government to modern infrastructure and cloud-based solutions is a fundamental necessity to building a digital government that is responsive to citizen needs and secure by design.  Doing so will enhance agencies’ ability to protect sensitive data, reduce costs, and deliver world-class services to the public.
